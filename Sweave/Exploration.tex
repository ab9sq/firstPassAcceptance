\section{Introduction}
The data is processed using R, Version 3.4.3 named Kite-Eating Tree. The only
extension (package or library) utilized is lubridate (version 1.7.1) to provide
key functionality in the processing of dates.

The data is read into R from a comma seperate value (csv) file which is derived
from the spreadsheet without modification. Additional values are computed as needed.
